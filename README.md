# Control Your Robot!
This project aims to provide a comprehensive and ready-to-use pipeline for embodied intelligence research, covering everything from robotic arm control, data collection, to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model training and deployment.

## Quick Start!
Since this project includes several test examples, such as robotic arm tests, visual simulation, and full robot simulation, it is possible to quickly understand the overall framework without requiring any physical hardware.  
Because no hardware is needed, you can install the environment simply by running:

```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```  
This project provides special debug levels: `"DEBUG"`, `"INFO"`, and `"ERROR"`. To fully observe the data flow, set it to `"DEBUG"`:
```bash
export INFO_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```

Alternatively, you can set it in the main function:
```python
import os
os.environ["INFO_LEVEL"] = "DEBUG" # DEBUG , INFO, ERROR
```

1. Data Collection Tests
```bash
# Multi-process (strict time-synchronized collection using TimeScheduler)
python example/collect/collect_mp_robot.py
# Multi-process (separate process for each component)
python example/collect/collect_mp_component.py
# Single-threaded (may have accumulated delays due to function execution)
python example/collect/collect.py
```

2. Model Deployment Tests
```bash
# Run a straightforward deployment test
python example/deploy/robot_on_test.py
# General deployment script
bash deploy.sh
# Offline data replay consistency test
bash eval_offline.sh
```

3. Remote Deployment and Data Transfer
```bash
# Start the server first, simulating the inference side (allows multiple connections, listens on a port)
python scripts/server.py
# On the client side, collect data and execute commands (example only executes 10 times)
python scripts/client.py
```

4. Interesting Scripts
```python
# Collect keypoints and perform trajectory replay
python scripts/collect_moving_ckpt.py 
# SAPIEN simulation, see planner/README.md for details
```

5. Debug Scripts
```bash
# Because controller and sensor packages have __init__.py, execute with -m
python -m controller.TestArm_controller
python -m sensor.TestVision_sensor
python -m my_robot.test_robot
```

6. Data Conversion Scripts
```bash
# After running python example/collect/collect.py and obtaining trajectories
python scripts/convert2rdt_hdf5.py save/test_robot/ save/rdt/
```

7. upload data
```bash
# In the original dataset, image files occupy a large amount of storage space, which is unfavorable for data transmission. Therefore, a compression and decompression script is provided. It performs JPEG processing on the images to enable faster transfer. The script is configured by default for a dual-arm, three-view setup, but it can be adjusted according to specific needs.
# compress. will make a new floder: path/to/floder/_zip/
python scripts/upload_zip.py path/to/floder --encode

# decompress.
python scripts/upload_zip.py path/to/floder
```
