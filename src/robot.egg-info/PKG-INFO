              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

# (untested on real robot) Data collect pipeline now can choose to save the data into the format you want!
You can try it by switch to the branch--`newest` to have a try.  
A function added at `CollectAny` called `_add_data_transform_pipeline()`, add we provide two choice under `utils/data_transofrm_pipeline.py`:
1. `image_rgb_encode_pipeline`  
this will encode every egb image in your data, then save it, it will cost lower memory for data saving by using jepg.
2. `general_hdf5_rdt_format_pipeline`  
this will save the data into rdt_hdf5 format without instruction.

# RoboTwin depoly pipeline support!
Now we already support RoboTwin pipeline! You can refer to under step for your Sim2Real experiment!
1. link `RoboTwin` policy to `control_your_robot` policy
```bash
# example
ln -s path/to/RoboTwin/polciy/pi0 path/to/control_your_robot/policy/
```

2. modify `deploy.sh`
By using `RoboTwin` pipeline, you should set `--robotwin` first, then extra info should be set like:
```bash
# pi0 eval.sh
python script/eval_policy.py --config policy/$policy_name/deploy_policy.yml \
    --overrides \
    --task_name ${task_name} \
    --task_config ${task_config} \
    --train_config_name ${train_config_name} \
    --model_name ${model_name} \
    --ckpt_setting ${model_name} \
    --seed ${seed} \
    --policy_name ${policy_name} 

# your deploy.sh
python example/deploy/deploy.py \
    --base_model_name "openpi"\
    --base_model_class "None"\
    --base_model_path "None"\
    --base_task_name "test"\
    --base_robot_name "test_robot"\
    --base_robot_class "TestRobot"\
    --robotwin \
    --overrides \
    --task_name ${task_name} \
    --task_config ${task_config} \
    --train_config_name ${train_config_name} \
    --model_name ${model_name} \
    --ckpt_setting ${model_name} \
    --seed ${seed} \
    --policy_name ${policy_name} 
```
By `RoboTwin` pipeline, some of the `base_` index may not make effect, here use None instead. Also some of the RoboTwin setting not take effect, you could ignore it.

Other deploy info you could refer to RoboTwin Document, like some of the model should modify `deploy_policy.yml`.

# Control Your Robot!
This project aims to provide a comprehensive and ready-to-use pipeline for embodied intelligence research, covering everything from robotic arm control, data collection, to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model training and deployment.

## Quick Start!
Since this project includes several test examples, such as robotic arm tests, visual simulation, and full robot simulation, it is possible to quickly understand the overall framework without requiring any physical hardware.  
Because no hardware is needed, you can install the environment simply by running:

```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 # or
 GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 uv sync
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 uv pip install -e .
```  
This project provides special debug levels: `"DEBUG"`, `"INFO"`, and `"ERROR"`. To fully observe the data flow, set it to `"DEBUG"`:
```bash
export INFO_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```

Alternatively, you can set it in the main function:
```python
import os
os.environ["INFO_LEVEL"] = "DEBUG" # DEBUG , INFO, ERROR
```

1. Data Collection Tests
```bash
# Multi-process (strict time-synchronized collection using TimeScheduler)
python example/collect/collect_mp_robot.py
# Multi-process (separate process for each component)
python example/collect/collect_mp_component.py
# Multi-process (separate process for each component, and have diffrent save_freq for each, this will save timestamp)
python example/collect/collect_mp_component_different_time_freq.py
# Single-threaded (may have accumulated delays due to function execution)
python example/collect/collect.py
```

2. Model Deployment Tests
```bash
# Run a straightforward deployment test
python example/deploy/robot_on_test.py
# General deployment script
bash deploy.sh
# Offline data replay consistency test
# you should generate data at least 3 data first by running: python example/collect/collect.py
bash eval_offline.sh
```

3. Remote Deployment and Data Transfer
```bash
# Start the server first, simulating the inference side (allows multiple connections, listens on a port)
python scripts/server.py
# On the client side, collect data and execute commands (example only executes 10 times)
python scripts/client.py
```

4. Interesting Scripts
```python
# Collect keypoints and perform trajectory replay
python scripts/collect_moving_ckpt.py 
# SAPIEN simulation, see planner/README.md for details
```

5. Debug Scripts
```bash
# Because controller and sensor packages have __init__.py, execute with -m
python -m src.robot.controller.TestArm_controller
python -m src.robot.sensor.TestVision_sensor
python -m my_robot.test_robot
```

6. Data Conversion Scripts
```bash
# After running python example/collect/collect.py and obtaining trajectories
python scripts/convert2rdt_hdf5.py save/test_robot/ save/rdt/
```

7. upload data
```bash
# In the original dataset, image files occupy a large amount of storage space, which is unfavorable for data transmission. Therefore, a compression and decompression script is provided. It performs JPEG processing on the images to enable faster transfer. The script is configured by default for a dual-arm, three-view setup, but it can be adjusted according to specific needs.
# compress. will make a new floder: path/to/floder/_zip/
python scripts/upload_zip.py path/to/floder --encode

# decompress.
python scripts/upload_zip.py path/to/floder
```

8. telop by joint/eef
```bash
# We provide two general architectures for teleoperation-based data collection. The first one is relatively simple, where the teleoperation control frequency is aligned with the data collection frequency. The second one is slightly more complex, allowing the teleoperation frequency to far exceed the data recording frequency. Both architectures have been validated through real-world robot experiments.
# same freq
python example/teleop/master_slave_arm_teleop.py 
# diff freq
python example/teleop/master_slave_arm_teleop_fs.py
```

## On real robot!
1. 实现你的机器人配置
``` python
必要:
__init__(self): 初始化所有的controller和sensor
set_up(self): 执行对应controller和sensor的set_up参数
可选:
is_start(self): 判断是否机械臂正在运动
reset(self): 让机械臂回到初始位置
```
